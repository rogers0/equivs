Description: Dummy package to fulfil package dependencies
 This is a dummy package that makes Debian's package management
 system believe that equivalents to packages on which other
 packages do depend on are actually installed.
 .
 Deinstallation of this package is only possible when all pending
 dependency issues are properly resolved in some other way. A more
 brutal approach for it's deinstallation is to create and install
 this package configured using an empty control file.
 .
 Please note that this is a crude hack and if thoughtlessly used
 might possibly do damage to your packaging system. And please
 note as well that using it is not the recommended way of dealing
 with broken dependencies. Better file a bug report instead.
