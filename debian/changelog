equivs (1.0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Complete overhaul (and hopefully simplification) of "equivs".
  * Updated README.debian with a clearer description of the package's 
    usage and instructions on how to remove it again. I hope "equivs"
    is pretty foolproof by now.
  * Changed debian/rules and the preinst/postinst files to use the
    configuration file "/etc/equivs.conf".
  * Added debian/purge file.

equivs (1.0.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

    there is no compiled binary included. This closes bug #16878.
  * Minor changes to debian/rules.

    mindlessly used.

equivs (1.0.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a small description of the build procedure to the README.debian 
    file upon proposal of <Martin.Bialasinski@uni-koeln.de>.

  * Added credit to Markus Dickebohm <m.dickebohm@uni-koeln.de> for the 
    information which enabled me to make up this package. ;-)

  * Various changes to debian/rules so that the current configuration is
    added to the documentation as "/usr/doc/equivs/current.conf".
