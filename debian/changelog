    files to be put into /usr/doc/packagename

    suitable for upload to the distribution

    use own files 
  * Renamed make-control to equivs-control and
            make-equivs to equivs-build

    names after some time not working on equivs, so the scripts were
    obviously named wrong.

    correctly
  * Fixes wishlist bug #27215

equivs (1.999.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Maintainer
  * Complete rewrite. Instead recreating the equivs package, one now
    creates new fake packages
  * No problem with apt anymore. To apt, the information fetched from 
    it's sources has precedence over information hold localy by dpkg.
    So a recompiled equivs packages was not recognised correctly.
  * Changed versionnumber to a debian-only one.

 -- Martin Bialasinski <martinb@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Jan 1999 12:35:16 +0100

  * Added correct FSF postal address into debian/copyright as 
    suggested by lintian check.

 -- Paul Seelig <pseelig@goofy.zdv.uni-mainz.de>  Sun, 22 Feb 1998 07:49:23 +0100

equivs (1.0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Complete overhaul (and hopefully simplification) of "equivs".
  * Updated README.debian with a clearer description of the package's 
    usage and instructions on how to remove it again. I hope "equivs"
    is pretty foolproof by now.
  * Changed debian/rules and the preinst/postinst files to use the
    configuration file "/etc/equivs.conf".
  * Added debian/purge file.

 -- Paul Seelig <pseelig@goofy.zdv.uni-mainz.de>  Sat, 07 Feb 1998 16:34:32 +0100

  * Made equivs install it's own source into /usr/src/

  * Added warnings about possible damage of package dependencies if 
    mindlessly used.

 -- Paul Seelig <pseelig@goofy.zdv.uni-mainz.de>  Thu, 04 Dec 1997 05:04:03 +0100

equivs (1.0.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

    file upon proposal of <Martin.Bialasinski@uni-koeln.de>.

  * Added credit to Markus Dickebohm <m.dickebohm@uni-koeln.de> for the 
    information which enabled me to make up this package. ;-)

  * Various changes to debian/rules so that the current configuration is
    added to the documentation as "/usr/doc/equivs/current.conf".

 -- Paul Seelig <pseelig@goofy.zdv.uni-mainz.de>  Mon, 29 Sep 1997 22:24:03 +0100

equivs (1.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low
